            <p>Zhiyong zhencao qianzhiwen (智永《真草千字文》) [1], written by Zenji Zhiyong, the seventh grandson of Wang Xizhi, was transmitted to Japan by Japanese envoys during the Tang dynasty and dedicated to Emperor Shomu, who, after his death, was supported by Empress Guangming, who provided the post with a batch of relics for Todaiji Temple, and the original post was then transferred to the collection of the Japanese Tetsumi Taniguchi, and then returned to the ownership of Ogawa Weijiro, who is now collecting it as the heir to his son's collection [2], which is the only surviving ink version of Zhiyong's "True Cursive Qianzifen (真草千字文)".</p>
