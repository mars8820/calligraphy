            <p>The "Self-scripted Confession," in regular script on paper, with thirty-three lines, two hundred and fifty-three characters, and thirteen lines of small characters, is said to have been written in ink by Yan Zhenqing. It is now in the Nakamura Fusetsu Shodo Museum in Japan. The post is dignified and simple, strong and powerful, with a kind of ancient weather and temple atmosphere, for his later years, the representative works of the mature style period.
